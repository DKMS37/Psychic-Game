# Psychic-Game Instructions how to make it:

1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/qTc45Lox97g).

2. The game is just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app or the computer randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app or the computer chose. 

the following text should be on your page:

3. Guess what letter I'm thinking of?

4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left, "minumum of 9 but can be change" This will update when guesses left runs out.)

7. Your letter Guessed So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
